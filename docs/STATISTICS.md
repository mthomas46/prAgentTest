# Code Statistics and Metrics

This page provides visualizations and metrics about the codebase's structure and quality.

## Overview

The following visualizations and metrics are generated dynamically based on the current state of the codebase.

### Code Size Distribution
<div id="code-size-chart" class="chart-container"></div>

### File Type Distribution
<div id="file-type-chart" class="chart-container"></div>

### Complexity Metrics
<div id="complexity-metrics" class="metrics-container">
    <div class="metric-card">
        <h3>Cyclomatic Complexity</h3>
        <div id="cyclomatic-complexity"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="metric-card">
        <h3>Lines of Code</h3>
        <div id="lines-of-code"></div>
    </div>
</div>

### Code Quality Metrics
<div id="quality-metrics" class="metrics-container">
    <div class="metric-card">
        <h3>Code Smells</h3>
        <div id="code-smells"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="metric-card">
        <h3>Type Coverage</h3>
        <div id="type-coverage"></div>
    </div>
</div>

## Methodology

These metrics are calculated using various tools and techniques:

- **Code Size**: Analyzed using `cloc` (Count Lines of Code)
- **Complexity**: Measured using TypeScript's built-in complexity analysis
- **Type Coverage**: Calculated based on type annotations and interfaces
- **Code Smells**: Identified through static analysis and best practices review

## Historical Trends

The following chart shows how these metrics have changed over time:

<div id="historical-trends" class="chart-container"></div>

## Recommendations

Based on the current metrics, here are some recommendations for improving code quality:

1. **Type Safety**: Consider increasing type coverage in areas with lower coverage
2. **Complexity**: Review functions with high cyclomatic complexity
3. **Code Organization**: Consider splitting larger files into smaller, more focused modules
4. **Documentation**: Ensure all new code includes proper documentation

## Notes

- Metrics are updated automatically when the documentation is rebuilt
- Historical data is maintained for trend analysis
- All visualizations are interactive and can be explored in detail
