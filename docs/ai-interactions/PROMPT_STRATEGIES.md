# Prompt Strategies

## Purpose and Context
This document serves as a comprehensive guide for effectively interacting with the LLM in our development process. It outlines strategies for constructing prompts that yield accurate, relevant, and actionable responses.

## Key Objectives
- Document effective prompt construction techniques
- Maintain consistency in communication
- Improve prompt effectiveness
- Reduce iterations
- Ensure comprehensive documentation

## Document Structure
1. Core Strategies
2. Best Practices
3. Examples
4. Interaction Patterns
5. Response Patterns
6. Prompt Permutations
7. Grammatical Structures

## Core Strategies

### 1. Contextual Layering
- Start with high-level context
- Add specific details gradually
- Include relevant background information
- Maintain conversation history

### 2. Progressive Prompting
- Begin with broad questions
- Narrow down to specific details
- Build upon previous responses
- Validate understanding at each step

### 3. Keyword Optimization
- Use precise technical terms
- Include relevant domain-specific vocabulary
- Maintain consistent terminology
- Avoid ambiguous language

### 4. Grammar and Structure
- Use clear, concise sentences
- Follow logical flow
- Include proper punctuation
- Maintain consistent formatting

### 5. Context Preservation
- Reference previous interactions
- Maintain conversation thread
- Build upon established context
- Track decision history

### 6. Response Validation
- Verify understanding
- Request clarification when needed
- Confirm accuracy of responses
- Validate implementation details

## Best Practices

### 1. Documentation Integration
- Include code examples
- Reference relevant documentation
- Maintain consistent formatting
- Update documentation as needed

### 2. Iterative Development
- Start with basic implementation
- Add complexity gradually
- Test at each stage
- Refine based on feedback

### 3. Quality Assurance
- Verify code accuracy
- Test implementations
- Validate documentation
- Ensure consistency

## Examples

### 1. Basic Prompt
```
Can you help me implement a logging service?
```

### 2. Contextual Prompt
```
I'm working on a microservices architecture. Can you help me implement a logging service that will handle distributed tracing?
```

### 3. Detailed Prompt
```
I'm implementing a logging service for our microservices architecture. We need:
- Distributed tracing support
- Log aggregation
- Error tracking
- Performance monitoring
Can you help with the implementation?
```

## Interaction Patterns

### 1. Documentation Requests
- Request specific documentation updates
- Include context and requirements
- Specify expected format
- Request examples

### 2. Code Implementation
- Describe requirements clearly
- Include technical constraints
- Specify expected behavior
- Request testing recommendations

### 3. Problem Solving
- Describe the problem clearly
- Include error messages
- Specify environment details
- Request step-by-step solutions

## Response Patterns

### 1. Code Generation
- Provide complete implementations
- Include comments and documentation
- Explain key concepts
- Suggest testing approaches

### 2. Documentation
- Create structured documentation
- Include examples
- Explain concepts clearly
- Maintain consistent format

### 3. Problem Resolution
- Analyze the problem
- Provide solution options
- Explain implementation steps
- Suggest verification methods

## Prompt Permutations

### 1. Basic Structure
```
[Context] + [Request] + [Constraints]
```

### 2. Detailed Structure
```
[Background] + [Current State] + [Requirements] + [Constraints] + [Expected Outcome]
```

### 3. Complex Structure
```
[Project Context] + [Technical Requirements] + [Implementation Details] + [Testing Requirements] + [Documentation Needs]
```

## Grammatical Structures

### 1. Question Format
```
Can you help me [action] with [context]?
```

### 2. Request Format
```
I need help with [task] that involves [details].
```

### 3. Problem Format
```
I'm encountering [issue] when [context]. Can you help me resolve this?
```
