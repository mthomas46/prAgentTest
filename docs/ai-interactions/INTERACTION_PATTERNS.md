# AI Interaction Patterns

## Overview
This document outlines the patterns of interaction between the user and the LLM during the development process. These patterns have been refined through our development process and reflect our approach to AI-assisted development.

## Common Interaction Types

### 1. Documentation Requests
- **Pattern**: User requests documentation updates or improvements
- **Example**: "Enhance the documentation for the gateway service"
- **Response Pattern**: 
  - Analysis of existing documentation
  - Structured improvements
  - Code examples and explanations
  - Formatting enhancements

### 2. Code Implementation
- **Pattern**: User requests specific feature implementations
- **Example**: "Implement the authentication service"
- **Response Pattern**:
  - Understanding requirements
  - Providing implementation options
  - Code generation with explanations
  - Testing recommendations

### 3. Problem Solving
- **Pattern**: User presents technical challenges
- **Example**: "Fix the message queue performance issue"
- **Response Pattern**:
  - Problem analysis
  - Solution proposals
  - Implementation steps
  - Verification methods

### 4. Architecture Decisions
- **Pattern**: User seeks architectural guidance
- **Example**: "How should we structure our microservices?"
- **Response Pattern**:
  - Architecture analysis
  - Best practice recommendations
  - Trade-off explanations
  - Implementation strategies

### 5. Code Review
- **Pattern**: User requests code review or improvements
- **Example**: "Review the API gateway implementation"
- **Response Pattern**:
  - Code analysis
  - Improvement suggestions
  - Best practice recommendations
  - Specific examples

## Effective Communication Patterns

### 1. Clear Requirements
- Provide specific context
- Include relevant code snippets
- Specify expected outcomes
- Mention constraints or limitations

### 2. Iterative Development
- Start with high-level overview
- Progress to detailed implementation
- Request clarification when needed
- Validate understanding

### 3. Feedback Loop
- Provide feedback on suggestions
- Request modifications when needed
- Clarify misunderstandings
- Confirm successful implementations

### 4. Context Management
- Maintain conversation context
- Reference previous discussions
- Build upon established solutions
- Track decision history

## Best Practices

### 1. For Users
- Be specific in requests
- Provide sufficient context
- Ask for clarification when needed
- Give feedback on responses

### 2. For LLM
- Break down complex tasks
- Provide clear explanations
- Include code examples
- Suggest best practices

### 3. For Collaboration
- Maintain clear communication
- Document decisions
- Track progress
- Review and refine

## Common Challenges

### 1. Context Limitations
- Solution: Provide clear context
- Include relevant code
- Reference previous discussions
- Maintain conversation history

### 2. Technical Complexity
- Solution: Break down problems
- Provide step-by-step guidance
- Include examples
- Validate understanding

### 3. Implementation Details
- Solution: Be specific in requests
- Include constraints
- Provide examples
- Request clarification

### 4. Documentation Quality
- Solution: Follow templates
- Include examples
- Maintain consistency
- Review and refine
