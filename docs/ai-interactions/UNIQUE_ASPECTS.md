# Unique Aspects of AI Interaction

## Overview
This document outlines the unique aspects of our AI interaction approach, focusing on the strategies and patterns that have proven effective in our development process.

## Key Aspects

### 1. Documentation-First Approach
- Prioritize documentation before implementation
- Create comprehensive API documentation
- Maintain up-to-date README files
- Include detailed development instructions

### 2. Incremental Development
- Start with basic functionality
- Add features gradually
- Test at each stage
- Refine based on feedback

### 3. Service Evolution
- Regular service improvements
- Continuous refactoring
- Focus on stability
- Enhanced testing

### 4. Quality Focus
- Emphasis on code quality
- Comprehensive testing
- Proper error handling
- Complete documentation

## Interaction Patterns

### 1. Clear Requirements
- Provide specific context
- Include relevant code snippets
- Specify expected outcomes
- Mention constraints

### 2. Iterative Development
- Start with high-level overview
- Progress to detailed implementation
- Request clarification when needed
- Validate understanding

### 3. Feedback Loop
- Provide feedback on suggestions
- Request modifications when needed
- Clarify misunderstandings
- Confirm successful implementations

### 4. Context Management
- Maintain conversation context
- Reference previous discussions
- Build upon established solutions
- Track decision history

## Best Practices

### 1. For Users
- Be specific in requests
- Provide sufficient context
- Ask for clarification when needed
- Give feedback on responses

### 2. For LLM
- Break down complex tasks
- Provide clear explanations
- Include code examples
- Suggest best practices

### 3. For Collaboration
- Maintain clear communication
- Document decisions
- Track progress
- Review and refine
