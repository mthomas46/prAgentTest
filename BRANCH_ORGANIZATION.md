- Database management for tests

## Benefits of This Organization

1. **Focused Code Reviews**: Each branch addresses a specific concern, making reviews more targeted
2. **Easier Rollbacks**: If issues arise, you can roll back specific features without affecting others
3. **Parallel Development**: Teams can work on different features simultaneously
4. **Clear Documentation**: Each branch has a clear purpose and set of changes
5. **Simplified Merging**: Related changes are grouped together, reducing merge conflicts

This organization aligns with your focus on build optimization and security while providing a clear structure for future development work.
